# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction 
This project explores and predicts hourly bike rental demand using historical usage data and weather conditions.

## What I Did
- Performed EDA (exploratory data analysis) on hourly rental data
- Built and evaluated a Linear Regression model
- Visualized model performance using actual vs. predicted plots
- Discussed findings and future improvements

## Goals
Help bike-sharing services better allocate bikes during peak and low-demand hours.

## Files Included
- `bike-sharing-demand.ipynb`: Full analysis + modeling
- `actual_vs_predicted.png`: Visualization of prediction accuracy
- `README.md`: This file

## Dataset
The dataset is from [Kaggleâ€™s Bike Sharing Demand competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/data)
